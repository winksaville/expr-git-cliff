# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

### Other

- Add cliff.toml

 - Accomplished using `git cliff --init` with no other changes.
 - git-cliff was previously installed with `cargo install git-cliff`.

- Add first CHANGELOG.md

The CHANGELOG.md file is practically empty as by default I do not use
"Conventional Commits".

 - Created with `git cliff > CHANGELOG.md`

TODO: Will need to edit `cliff.toml` to allow `unconventional` commits.

- An actual CHANGELOG.md

 - it's very noisy
 - And indented dashes in commit messages look like commits :(


## [0.2.0] - 2022-04-08

### Other

- Change the message of main

I want it to be more specific.

- Add licenses

This is dual licensed both APACHE and MIT.

- Add README.md

Added a Title and a introducing sentence.

- Bump version to v0.2.0

This is now a minimal experiment.


## [0.1.0] - 2022-04-08

### Other

This was created using `cargo new --bin expr-git-cliff`
